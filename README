What's this about?
------------------

vdrnfofs creates a virtual Fuse-based file system that maps recordings
from the Linux Video Disc Recorder (VDR) to *.nfo and *.mpg files.

Those files can then e.g. be used by media center applications like.
XBMC or Enna.

Such a thing has been tried previously here:

  http://code.google.com/p/vdrfs/

But this project seems to be abandoned, so I've started with vdrnfofs from
scratch.

VDR recordings (PS or TS) are simply mapped 1:1 to *.mpg files. If the VDR
recording is split to multiple files, they are virtually concatenated to a
single *.mpg file. If the recording contains cut marks, the cut-out parts
are omitted, so the *.mpg file is played as cut, see below.

The *.nfo is a XML file with the follwing structure:

  <movie>
    <title>...</title>
    <plot>...</plot>
  </movie>

Title and plot are mapped from VDR's info file ('T' and 'D').


How to install?
---------------

In order to be able to use vdrnofs, python-setuptools and python-fuse are
required.

If not installing from a package of your preferred Linux distribution run:

  ./setup.py install

The user which should be able to mount vdrnfofs should be a member of the 
group "fuse".


How to use?
-----------

To mount a vdrnfofs file system, run:

  vdrnfofs <mount-point> -o video=<vdr-vide-dir>

e.g.:

   vdrnfofs /mnt/vdrnfofs -o video=/var/lib/video

You can also do this in /etc/fstab with:

   vdrnfofs    /mnt/vdrnfofs   fuse    video=/var/lib/video 0 0

By default only the user that mounted the vdrnfos can also access it.
If you want system-wide access to the file system, you should mount it as root
and pass the option "allow_other" e.g.:

   vdrnfofs /mnt/vdrnfofs -o video=/var/lib/video - o allow_other

If vdrnfofs is not in your path for root (Debian and Ubuntu most likely do not
include /usr/local/bin in the path), you might need to provide the full path
in fstab, like e.g.:

   /usr/local/bin/vdrnfofs    /mnt/vdrnfofs   fuse    video=/var/lib/video 0 0

To process cut marks, run the provided script 'gencutindex' inside the
recording directory. This generates a special file called cutindex from the
marks and index files, which is read by vdrnfofs. To get the recording in uncut
form, you can remove this file and leave the marks or marks.vdr file alone.
